# Turtle Crossing Game

This project is a simple arcade-style game built with Python's `turtle` graphics module. The player controls a turtle that must cross a busy road filled with moving cars. Each time the player reaches the finish line, the game level increases and the cars move faster.

## Features

- Player movement using the keyboard
- Randomly generated cars with different colors
- Collision detection between player and cars
- Scoreboard to track levels
- Game over screen

## How to Play

- Use the `Up` arrow key to move the turtle upwards.
- Avoid the cars and reach the top of the screen to level up.
- The game ends if the turtle collides with a car.

## Course Attribution

This project is part of Dr. Angela Yu's **100 Days of Code: The Complete Python Pro Bootcamp for 2025**.  
It is an exercise from the course to practice object-oriented programming and working with the `turtle` module.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- `turtle` module (usually included with Python)

## Running the Game
